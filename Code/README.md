#About the Code
In this directory are the code files, written by George Tuli in Python, for the robot.

The PicoBorg Reverse and xboxdrv libraries will need to be installed on the Raspberry to run these programs.

Running `sudo apt-get install xboxdrv` will install the xbox drv libraries.

Follow the instructions on the [PiBorg web site](https://www.piborg.org/picoborgrev/install) to install the PicoBorg reverse libraries.
