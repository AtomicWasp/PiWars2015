# PiWars2015
Welome to our Pi Wars 2015 repository.  This is where we'll share the designs (.ai, .svg, .pdf) and the code (.py) for our 2015 entry to the Pi Wars robot competition.

Pi Wars is a Raspberry Pi-based robot competition; the entrants are tasked to build a robot using a Raspberry Pi was the main controller, to complete various challenges, such as straigh-line speed, proximity-alert, and aesthetics.  Our entry for the 2015 competition was 'Positronic' - an A4-category robot capable of holonomic drive, thanks to the genius of omnidirectional wheels.
