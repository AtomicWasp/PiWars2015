#About the Designs
In this directory are the designs we used for the robot, drawn by George Tuli using Adobe Illustrator.  We've made the designs available in their original Illustrator format (.ai), as well as in PDF and SVG formats.

The acrylic files are for the base, sides (minus the wooden side panels), ball pusher, sensor mounts
